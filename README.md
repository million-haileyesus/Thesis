# Thesis Ideas


### 1. **Player Movement Analysis**
   - **Player Positioning & Heatmaps**: Track the movement of individual players throughout the match, and generate heatmaps to visualize their most frequent locations on the field. This can help understand player positioning in different phases of the game (defense, attack, transition).
     - **Research Question**: How does player positioning vary between successful and unsuccessful teams or players?
   
   - **Speed and Acceleration**: Calculate the speed and acceleration of players using their coordinates over time.
     - **Research Question**: How do top players’ speed and acceleration compare during different phases of the game (e.g., sprints vs. defensive tracking)?

   - **Fatigue Analysis**: Investigate how a player’s movement changes over time, especially in the second half or in extra time.
     - **Research Question**: Is there a significant decrease in players' movement intensity toward the end of matches?

### 2. **Team Shape & Tactics**
   - **Team Formation & Shape**: Analyze the overall formation and shape of a team during different stages of the match. You can group player positions and detect the typical formation (e.g., 4-3-3 or 5-3-2) and how it evolves during offensive or defensive actions.
     - **Research Question**: How do teams adapt their formations in response to match events such as scoring or conceding a goal?

   - **Zonal Defending vs. Man-marking**: Identify whether players stick closely to their assigned zones or track specific opponents.
     - **Research Question**: Do top teams use zonal defending or man-marking more effectively?

   - **Space Occupation and Exploitation**: Quantify how much space players occupy and how well they exploit open areas on the field.
     - **Research Question**: Which teams are better at exploiting space in offensive transitions?

### 3. **Ball Movement Analysis**
   - **Pass Analysis**: Track the passes between players using the ball’s coordinates and identify patterns such as pass networks.
     - **Research Question**: How do passing networks vary between successful and unsuccessful teams?

   - **Build-up Play**: Investigate how the ball is moved from defense to attack by looking at sequences of passes, dribbles, and ball possession phases.
     - **Research Question**: What are the key differences in ball progression between top-performing and lower-performing teams?

   - **Ball Speed and Possession**: Analyze the speed of the ball in different phases (passing, dribbling) and its correlation with possession time.
     - **Research Question**: Is there a relationship between ball speed and successful possession sequences?

### 4. **Event Detection and Prediction**
   - **Goal/Shot Prediction**: Use ball and player coordinates to predict when a shot on goal will occur based on player positioning and ball movement.
     - **Research Question**: Can we predict goal-scoring opportunities based on ball movement patterns and player positioning?

   - **Defensive Interventions**: Analyze how defenders' movements lead to successful tackles, interceptions, or blocks.
     - **Research Question**: What are the common movement patterns of defenders leading to successful interceptions?

### 5. **Player Interaction & Synergy**
   - **Player Pair Synergy**: Identify which players tend to interact most frequently based on passing, positioning, and ball movements.
     - **Research Question**: Which player pairs show the highest level of synergy and contribute to the team's success?

   - **Influential Players**: Use network analysis to determine which players are most central to the team’s play based on their involvement in passes or movements.
     - **Research Question**: How do central players in the passing network contribute to team performance?

### 6. **Comparison Between Players/Teams**
   - **Player Performance Metrics**: Compare performance metrics (distance covered, speed, possession involvement) across players or teams.
     - **Research Question**: What distinguishes elite midfielders in terms of movement and ball involvement compared to average players?

   - **Defensive vs. Offensive Contributions**: Quantify how players contribute to defense versus offense using their positioning and ball movement data.
     - **Research Question**: How do fullbacks’ movements differ in attacking versus defensive teams?

### 7. **Game Phases and Transitions**
   - **Transitions Between Phases**: Track how teams or players transition between offensive, defensive, and transition phases, using their coordinates to identify changes in movement patterns.
     - **Research Question**: How quickly do top teams transition from defense to offense, and how does this affect their chances of scoring?

   - **Counter-attacks**: Examine how counter-attacks develop by analyzing the speed of the ball and player positions relative to the opposition.
     - **Research Question**: What are the common features of successful counter-attacks in terms of player positioning and ball speed?

### 8. **Advanced Machine Learning/AI Models**
   - **Classification Models**: Develop models to classify actions such as passes, shots, dribbles, and defensive actions based on player and ball coordinates.
     - **Research Question**: Can we classify different game actions using player and ball movement data?

   - **Action Recognition**: Use machine learning algorithms to recognize complex game actions (e.g., set-pieces, dribbling, offensive builds) from the coordinate data.
     - **Research Question**: Can action recognition models predict set-piece effectiveness based on player positioning?
